# My Nvim

Thoughts about my (ideal?) nvim

## Keys

* **Only** use leader mappings that don't have a modification mapping without leader
* Use simple mnemonics

There are a few _categories_ that my make up the basic of my leader mappings:

- finding the right file to open
- jumping between symbols in a project
- code/language related actions and diagnostics
- navigating between symbols in the open buffer
- explore the project
