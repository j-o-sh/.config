# Joshs .config

## Neovim

Custom setup, loosely based on the [Kickstart NVIM](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) configuration.

It starts with `init.lua`.

### Directory Structure

### Plugins

We are using the [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager.

What follows is a list of all the plugins I use and a short description so that I remember what they are for.

#### Vim-Sleuth

[Vim-sleuth](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth) enables vim to determine tabstops based on the current file.

### Unused but interesting Plugins

I am trying to get a sense of the ecosystem. So I will not actively use a plugin unless I understand it's usecase. However I want a place to remind myself of interesting ones.

This is that space.

* [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) - a GIT plugin
* [Rhubarb](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb) - a GITHub plugin
