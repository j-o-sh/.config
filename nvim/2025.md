# 2025 Nvim


## Keybinds

- f: find
  - ff: find files


## Things to add

- lsp stuff
- snippets & custom snippets
- better find/replace over the current file (or all of them)
- completion
- git integration
- A git merge conflict story that shows a list of files with conflicts and has a way to choose mine/theirs/both on each conflict as well as fill and walk a quickfix list with conflicts
- change the way copying works so that I don't unintentionally overwrite the paste buffer (but am still able to do so if needed)
- completions should be set up in a way that doesn't interfere with typing flow, the way Auto-Open+Enter-To-Choose would do but still allows to cmp on snippets and access snippet _slots_

## Thinking about...

- AI integration: I definitable don't need AI auto-complete but it may be nice to have an integrated chat window that I can copy/paste from within neovim. Even better if that thing would somehow know the current file or project as context

- better quickfix list: I'd like to have the QF list look better (somewhat like telescope), ideally it wouldn't be a real buffer but a telescope like overlay that I can toggle, and I would wan't to be able to delete Items from the list, while going through it, using dd to delete a line.
